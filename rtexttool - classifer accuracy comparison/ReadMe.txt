Hello,

I have done using R programming.
To execute the code, please specify your working directory in setwd.
To install Rtextools lib, uncomment the 1st line "#install.packages("RTextTools")"

The code has been executed on the 5 data sets taken from 20news-bydate . Namely
alt.atheism
comp.graphics
rec.autos
rec.motorcycles
sci.space

The code has been tested and runs without any error on Rstudio.
Accuracies and other params are listed in the report

Thanks,
Shivu gururaj
